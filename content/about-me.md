# About Me

Hey, I'm Just_Irish (or Sean in the real world) and welcome to my humble little space in the absolute vastness that is the internet.

I grew up in the early '90s, my first console being the awesome [JVC X'Eye](https://sega.fandom.com/wiki/X'Eye) - a Sega Genesis created through a partnership between JVC and Sega - and the first game that I can remember on that console was my beloved [Dune: Battle for Arrakis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_II).

Ever since then, I've been gaming. Video games became my main passion and, through it, brought me to my other hobbies like writing, world creation, drawing, and other artistic avocations many people would label as a waste of time.

In this little recessed corner that I can call my own, my aim is to write about video games, and potentially other topics like film and tabletop games, in a care-free manner. No deadlines, no politics, no people pleasing - simply very unprofessional no-bullshit reviews, general thoughts, and anecdotes from the mind of an everyday insignificant gamer.

## What I Do

- Attempt to write about video games and my experiences with them
- Create mods for games like [Vintage Story](https://www.vintagestory.at/) and [Avorion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/445220/Avorion/)
- Dabble, tinker and Distrohop more than a person should

## My Setup

- **OS:** Linux, [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) (Arch-based)
- **Current Projects:**
    - Writing for the blog
    - Creating a TTRPG using the Basic Role Playing system (i.e. Call of Cthulu)
    - Attempting to actually complete a video game
- **Computer Hardware:**
    -   CPU: [AMD Ryzen 9 5900X](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08164VTWH)
