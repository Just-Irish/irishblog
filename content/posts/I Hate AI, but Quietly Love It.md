No, no, not in the sense that you are thinking - creep. I'm sorry, some of you weirdos out there are so far removed from normal societal behaviors that normal people not wanting to interact with you is wholly deserving. It's like watching a porn addict try to have a normal relationship - they can't - and they've done that to themselves. Just like you weirdies marrying the AI on your damn phone... I can't begin to comprehend the mental process. This is not my declaration of war against you, not at all; I'll be your friend, I'm just going to let you know you're really fucking weird and that it is wrong and that I'm slightly uncomfortable.

Well, enough with that tangent.

### What I've Used AI For

I've been using AI quite extensively as of late to assist me with many things. For instance, this blog. Not being fluent in html or understanding Hugo - which is what this blog is - was impedeing me from fleshing out the site the way I wanted it. So, I used Claude to help me fill in the blanks. Now I have a blog that is almost as minimal as a painted stone... If I wanted an unpainted stone for a blog I'd probably have chosen [bearblog.dev](https://bearblog.dev/) or [mataroa.blog](https://mataroa.blog/); WYSIWYG. Honestly perfectly simple and more sites should be like those.

So the AI Claude helped me design this blog to my liking, and I also used it for my [Vintage Story mod](https://www.insignificantgamer.blog/my-mods/). There was **absolutely no way in hell** I'd be able to create it by myself. I don't know any C# (pronounced C-sharp, if you're unaware), which is approximately 95% of the mod, but there was Claude who *does* know all of this and, with some ideas written down, away Claude went! It... it took me so long to actually finish the mod, though. Claude was running around with outdated information on Vintage Story, so there were some major hiccups needing circumventing, and also lots of trial and error. Now, if I just knew C# it's possible I'd have figured out the issues quicker, but that's up for debate.

Then I have all my ideas for my tabletop campaign I want to run. That's where ChatGPT came in. All these ideas, but no idea where to start and how to flesh out the information. So I started by making key features, facts, and people in my world and, as I started to do that, new ideas would be born. Then I'd hit send and ChatGPT would respond with, "Oh my, you're just so freaking amazing, these ideas are **SO** amazing, blah, blah, blah." ChatGPT is such an annoying kissass...

ChatGPT helped extensively with compiling my information into a well-structured comprehensive form and, as expected, also making mistakes trying to understand my incoherent ramblings which would then turn out to actually be a pleasant idea I want to incorporate.

Alongside all of that, ChatGPT was able to create images reflecting what I was envisioning for certain aspects of my game which is where we begin to enter the questionable territory of AI use.

### The Grey Area of AI Use

The problem with AI is that it has to learn from somewhere and the easiest place to do so is the entirety of the internet. I don't know the intricacies of how AI gathers its information, but I have to assume that it is mostly no-holds-barred and AI slithers into every little nook and cranny getting every snippet of ones and zeros it could possibly get its little metaphysical hands wrapped around.

Because of that we have had multiple situations where AI is creating art from copyrighted material. Hundreds, if not thousands, of artists have come out claiming they have been wronged and showing the receipts as proof. What took them hours, days, or even years to create or master had now been done or surpassed by this thinking machine in a matter of minutes, completely making the artist kind of irrelevent.

So at what point is AI okay to use? Personally, I think AI *should* be used, but with the caveat that whomever uses it **must** inform the public that whatever it is they created is not 100% genuine. So if an artist who uses AI creates something, they absolutely need to say, "Hey, I created this useing AI." With that information shared the public can now look at it and make proper critiques, but, more importantly, know that wahtever was created might have a copy/pasted influence.

I also believe that whenever AI is used in this way the AI automatically, or upon request, provide its sources for "inspiration"; you know, a sort of, "Ah yeah, I pulled this from the Mona Lisa by Leonardo de Vinci, I copied this from a digital picture of Bob Ross' haircut..." When we get into someone trying to sell a product, for instance, this sourced information needs to be on that label like the warning labels of electrical grooming devices.

### Why I Hate AI

This part is quite simple: it makes people lazy as hell, a lot of people who use it are not genuine, and it saps creativity.

I am a perfect example of AI making people lazy as hell. My C# Vintage Story mod? I can learn that. The images I had processed for my TTRPG? I can learn to draw exactly what I want. But I don't; AI has made it so quick and easy to do things you yourself cannot do. And that sucks. There's no better feeling than learning a craft, putting your knowledge and developed skills to the test, and creating something from nothing. But damn do I just want these things *right* **now**...

I had ChatGPT put together a "back-of-a-book" type summary based on all the key points of my TTRPG campaign I'm slowly accumulating material for and, while it hit all the beats and gave it a Hollywood-esque flair, it still didn't feel right. When you read it, I can only compare it to sounding ironically robotic (did I use that right?). But after getting some time to do it myself, when **I** wrote it out... I took a different approach. It's a summary hidden within a first-hand account of events within the world and, while I'm not that great of a writer, you can feel the energy better; and you can definitely tell a human wrote it!

Now I will always tell you if I used AI for something. I have my own sense of honor and dignity that I must fulfill and I cannot bear the shame of presenting something as my own when it most certainly is not. Well, there's a significant portion of the world that simply could care less about such things and are sweeping the web with what has become known as "AI Slop".

I'm going to use YouTube for this example and I'm sure you know why. YouTube is consumed in a *deluge* of this AI slop and you cannot escape it. People are out there making these videos - documentaries - by the day, establishing a fanbase, and are outshining genuine content creators who are actually putting in all the work and have been doing it for years only to be surpassed by a fake. It's horrible. And that fanbase of the AI channel for the most part has no idea it's AI since, well, there's no disclosure.

What makes it even worse is that since these AI scripted videos are churned out like the McNuggets from the McDonald's factory line, there's a lot of potential for error. And because of that, videos that are selling themselves as distributing factual information, these unaware fans will only consume thinking that there is nothing false being fed to them. I mean, it's on the internet; it must be true.

I was half-assed listening to a video that auto-played the other day that is a perfect example. The video was about Soviet generals critiquing the American XM1 tank (prototype M1 Abrams). It started delving into Soviet tactics that was meant to show why the XM1 would be garbage compared to the oh-so-perfect T-72 main battle tank: the Deep Battle doctrine. This is a very real doctrine that the USSR theorized and developed in the 1920s and '30s, but didn't get to use it until the end of World War II. It had some similarities to Nazi Germany's Blitzkrieg, but differed fundamentally. The video I was listening to instead says, <span style="color: var(--primary-color);">"*Deep Battle' was a brutal and elegant evolution of the* **Blitzkrieg tactics that HAD crushed Germany.**"</span>

<summary> Quote Providing Context to the Deep Battle Doctrine (Click to Expand)</summary>

> Indeed, by the early 1930s, the concept of <span style="color: var(--primary-color);">*glubokaya operatsiya*</span>, or deep operations, had become enshrined in Soviet doctrine and training. Tying new emerging technologies of aircraft, tanks, and motorization together with the idea of using large-scale mobile forces (Fronts) on separate axes of operations in the enemy’s rear, deep operations looked to disrupt rather than simply destroy the enemy’s defence. The Soviets put this doctrine to good use, particularly in 1944 and 1945. Faced with large-scale offensives on widely separated fronts, the Germans were unable to be strong at every point, and the cohesion of the overall German defence broke down.

Anyone who has expressed some interest in the history of World War II will be familiar with Blitzkrieg and will know that Blitzkrieg was the strategy Nazi Germany used in the 1940s campaign against Western Europe, **NOT** the tactics used to defeat Germany. This is such a fundamental screw up it's embarrassing and the people who are not aware will take the video's information as fact and then repeat it in conversation later on. Now, this isn't as big of a problem as I'm making it out to be since we have so much historical knowledge, books, documents, and, while few now, witnesses of World War II that anyone who makes this blunder can easily be corrected and shown the proof. The main issues are the fact that people, first of all, assume AI can't make mistakes even though it's clearly written at the bottom of ChatGPT's page - <span style="color: var(--primary-color);">*ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info*</span> - but secondly, the AI written script made a big mistake that nobody seems to have caught.

## It Can be Good or Bad; Depends on Who You Are

I've ranted long enough about this. Fact of the matter is that AI can be both beneficial and detrimental for people and society. And like anything else in this world those with honor and integrity will use it for fun or to actually make a difference, and those who could care less and have no shame will use it for all the despicable reasons you can think of. AI is now our world and we need to get used to it and we need to be able to spot it. You *can* spot AI and I highly encourage you to watch the video I link down below because we need to be able to recognize it and we need to call out the bullshit like a person would a snakeoil salesman.
