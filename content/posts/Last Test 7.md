A day in November I had a small bout of depression wash over me; a not too uncommon state of mind I deal with periodically. I was listening to YouTube like I usually do; sometimes allowing videos to auto-play due to apathy, clicking on a title or image that somewhat caught my interest, or actually seeking out the specific content that I needed. I needed something to kind of soothe my soul and I stumbled across a video that had a title along the lines of "*When Cartoon Character's Gave Us a Reality Check*" and the thumbnail was that of Uncle Iroh from Avatar: The Last Airbender. Uncle Iroh being one of my favorite characters and mentors from any cartoon, I clicked on the video. 

There were scenes from shows and movies that can be described as life-coach advice: Master Oogway from Kung Fu Panda speaking about past, future and present; Uncle Iroh - of course - speaking to Aang about life, tunnels and light; and a couple others. One of those scenes spliced into the eight minute dreary-tuned self-reflection mood-booster was that of a cartoon I never heard of. After a bit of search-engine magic I discovered it to be the show Final Space. Here's the kicker, though: what really pulled me in was the fact one of the characters was voiced by Ron Perlman. Well, also the part where the other character was having an all-too-familiar internal conflict with himself - self-doubt - but hey! Big daddy Perlman, papa Hellboy, Mr. War-Never-Changes. I couldn't resist, thus started my new small obsession.
