## Our Forever War; A Collection of Journals and First-hand Accounts of the Start of the Apocalypse

### From the journal of Lieutenant Arthur Bennett, 1st Coldstream Guards

 <span style="color: var(--primary-color); font-style: italic;">Are you familiar with the feeling of all the hairs on the back of your neck standing up? What about the numbness after sitting in an uncomfortable position for too long? Imagine those feelings, but so much greater, beginning in your chest and spreading throughout your body in a single instant. Everybody felt it at the exact same time that day, and we were woefully unaware of its meaning until we met Him.</span>

 <span style="color: #ffe970; font-style: bold;">“I have returned,” he said.</span> <span style="color: var(--primary-color); font-style: italic;">We couldn’t believe it. It was Him: Jesus Christ.</span> <span style="color: #ffe970; font-style: bold;">“Poor are the tidings I bring with my return, for the Battle of Armageddon has begun.”</span>

 <span style="color: var(--primary-color); font-style: italic;">Is this why America has gone silent? Is this why ships we send West to the shores of the Americas have never returned?</span>

<span style="color: #ffe970; font-style: bold;">“The Son of Perdition has claimed the land to the West.”</span>

 <span style="color: var(--primary-color); font-style: italic;">We had no idea that Jesus’ return would be so catastrophic. Months later we would receive word that Jerusalem had fallen. Jerusalem, the holiest of cities, conquered. Jesus would address us one last time:</span>
 
<span style="color: #ffe970; font-style: bold;">“My children. I have been striken with the most oppressive of pains. I must meet The Beast in battle for control of Jerusalem. Upon meeting my opposite my strength will be bound within mortal limits. My promise of paradise through faith must falter for there to be victory. Fret not for through faith I promise rebirth until the day of triumph.”</span>

 <span style="color: var(--primary-color); font-style: italic;">It took no time for scholars and religious leaders to agree upon what Christ had said: there would be no Heaven, only a repetition of life on Earth, until some victory that is achieved that we cannot begin to understand. Why should we continue with faith if faith gave us broken promises?</span>

 <span style="color: var(--primary-color); font-style: italic;">Months later after Christ’s departure from England, a towering creature landed on our shores. We were nothing more than roaches in its shadow. Our weapons, artillery… it did nothing. And thus it began its annihilation of London.</span>

 <span style="color: var(--primary-color); font-style: italic;">We fought and fought. Thousands died. We could do nothing except cause it the inconvenience of a mosquito to an elephant. That’s when the sky cracked, blue streaks of lightning arced across the city and we all saw a figure, a human, slam into the Nephilim.</span>

 <span style="color: var(--primary-color); font-style: italic;">A fight ensued between the two that seemed forever, but only a matter of minutes had actually passed. It was glorious and absolutely terrifying. The human won as a small handheld object cratered the skull of the giant, but the beast immediately began burning. The winds began to pick up, a storm out of no where, and the titan exploded as it fell into a red dust-like inferno.</span>

 <span style="color: var(--primary-color); font-style: italic;">Those of us nearby were enveloped in a sandstorm like never before seen. Mere meters away we began colliding with otherworldly forces. We fought our way from where the Nephilim died in hopes that we could escape the grainy torrent that hid these terrifying beasts.</span>

 <span style="color: var(--primary-color); font-style: italic;">A crack of lightning struck near us and there stood a man, warhammer in hand, becoming a wall between us and the horse-sized horned beast that was upon us. The man whipped his hammer and hit the beast with a thunderous crack and the sheer force caused it to disintegrate into a burst of gore and viscera. And then the man who had just saved our group from certain death was gone. But we could now see the edge of the red cloud and parts of an unscathed London, soldiers beyond in a defensive posture.</span>

 <span style="color: var(--primary-color); font-style: italic;">From there we erected fortifications along the edge. Many were killed as hellspawn wandered into our world. Some made it beyond the city and, even with our best trackers, vanished into our wilds to prey on travelers, farmers, and any other unfortunate enough to stumble upon them. This became our normalcy.</span>

## Welcome

This here is the start of my steampunk-themed apocalypse tabletop game. With some encouragement, this all came together during one of my many many boring days at work. First, small themes I found interesting, then lore and truths about the world I wanted to create began to meld.

### General Information

I still have a lot of work to do before the first session can begin, but here is a list of things that I have decided upon that I will continue to add to as I think of them:

- Game system I've chosen for this is Basic Roleplaying (i.e. Call of Cthulu). A straightforward d100 system that doesn't turn the game into a number-heavy strategy game, but also isn't lacking some genuine depth.

- FoundryVTT will be used for dice-rolling, character sheets, and dungeon crawling.

- This isn't meant to be a campaign, but moreso an easy one/two-session mission type of game.

- The old pantheons are real; Thor, Odin, Osiris, Zeus, Raa... 

- Theme of the game is a steampunk/clockwork-style mixed with real-world locations that takes place approximately 100-200 years after the late 1800s. The world has been ravaged by endless war between Humans, Angels, and Demons.

- Reincarnation exists, and there's a possibility you rememeber parts of your last life.

- Augmentations of the body is possible using Angelic or Infernal essence.

- Your character is a member of a mercenary guild known as The Penitent Guard; the poor, the forgotten, criminals, and those willing to face absolute horror just to have a home and food at the end of the day find themselves here.

- Other major mercenary guilds are:
    - The Seraphic Blades: An elite, oath-bound order wielding perfected essence augments. They are revered and feared, answering only to sanctioned city-governance and ecclesiastical authorities.
    - The Covenant of Iron: Engineers turned knights. Their armor is clockwork, their weapons experimental, their philosophy utilitarian. They often hold the wall-lines during Rift surges.

- **More to come...**
