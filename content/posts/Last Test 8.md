*The Forever Winter*, developed by [Fun Dog Studios](https://www.fundogstudios.com/), recently entered Early Access on Steam and the Epic Game Store on September 24th. This is an extraction shooter not like any other that you have played as it takes a completely different approach to the genre. It maintains the same aspect of what you're familiar with when it comes to an extraction-shooter: enter a raid, collect loot, and get the fuck out - but what makes it different from its peers is that you are absolutely not a hero, you are not a badass, you are not important whatsoever, and you are not meant to survive.

This post-apocalyptic wasteland is ravaged beyond recognition as the war has been ongoing for so long that the year is only known as "20XX" as all sense of time has been lost. And you, a mere scavenger, are there to collect whatever you can from giant mechs littering the open battlefield and claustrophobic trenches brimming with corpses to help keep your home operational and its people alive for another day.
