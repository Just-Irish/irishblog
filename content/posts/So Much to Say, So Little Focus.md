I don't know about you, but my mind won't shut the hell up sometimes. I'll wake up in the morning and think, "Alright, let's get started with... everything?" And then I'll proceed to get distracted from "everything" by everything. I'll be at work - my mindless, non-stimulating, all-work-is-busy-work, monkey-could-do-it job - and I'm just having these thorough encyclopedic-like ideas swarming down on me like a pissed off colony of bees.
