For quite a few years now video games have been on a downward spiral. The shareholders and upper management have been pushing for their next payday and the developers have been pushing product after product seemingly with the same enthusiasm as an ant within its colony only to be cast aside when there's no more use for them. The inevitable outcome is a game delivered unimaginative, spiritless, and more than likely broken; all the while it was touted by journalists and trailers at conventions as the "next big thing". So, ultimately, you're handed a shit-sandwich sprinkled with gold flakes sourced from someone's expelled detritus after a night of consuming Goldschläger. But hey, the bread looks good; that's all that matters, right? 

With this becoming the norm, people, but more specifically gamers such as myself, have become increasingly critical and wary, perhaps overly so in some, if not most, instances.

Well, recently the new(ish) studio *Build a Rocket Boy* (*BARB*) came onto the scene finally releasing their first IP *MindsEye* after approximately 8 years in development. It took no time at all for the game and studio to be torn a new rear end by most people. Even popular gaming journalism sites like GamesRadar are throwing shade at *BARB's* game.

The first major mistake was the studio deciding to use Epic Games Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). This game engine has been the bane of all video games recently released in the past couple years. Games using the engine run horribly even on brand new "better" hardware and look even worse than games released 15 years ago. But, according to some people online, that's merely because the developers don't know what they're doing with the engine and it's code. Well, if that's the case, this makes *BARB *and all the other studios using UE5 look even worse and UE5 actually the victim rather than a source.

So *MindsEye* has terrible performance due to UE5 demanding a quantum processor, is predisposed to look bad due to UE5's blurry visuals and blinding lighting, and - *at the fault of the gaming community* - was thought to be an equivalent to *Grand Theft Auto* due to how the game was presented and also the founder of *BARB*, [Leslie Benzies](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1267734/), previously having worked on most *GTA* games as a producer. While the comparisons can be expected, they shouldn't have dictated the gaming communities hype. All these factors ultimately boil into a nice steaming disappointment soup. And this is the problem. Now, I'm not about to say *BARB* and other studios are not at fault, they very much are, but I believe that we, too, are also at fault.

*BARB* came out on social media and stated that they are "heartbroken" that players are not able to enjoy their game as it was intended and, honestly, my first reaction was dismiss their apology as another parroted damage control press conference type of situation because of how I have programmed myself to respond to these things.

But what if it isn't? What if they're genuine and really are bothered that they delivered a product that under-delivered and cannot be enjoyed? Is it possible that our knee-jerk reactions to these new studios - or small if you're indie - could be too much and could possibly kill something great before it could be fully realized? I don't know, I'm a cynic; I already believe it's just a facade. *No Man's Sky* is one game that comes to mind that was extremely under-delivered and, as of today, sits at a **Very Positive** 82% review rating according to [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/275850/) and it is personally one of my favorite games to revisit and get lost in. Granted, it took a *minimum* of 5 years to get to where it should have been, but *it did recover*, and recover like a god it did.

I'm not going to touch on peoples claims that the game is genuinely garbage as I've no interest in buying or playing this game, this is just a bunch of hypotheticals and food for thought of when I saw the immediate backlash online to a game and studio I didn't even know existed. I do kind of miss not being so critical and just enjoying games for what they were, but the industry made me this way.
