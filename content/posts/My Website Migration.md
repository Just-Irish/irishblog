Hello, and welcome to my new website! This post is mostly to get my very first subscription newsletter sent out to inform you of my website's migration to a new host and new domain name. Be sure to check out my most recent post as only those who received it directly from me have seen it: [I Hate AI, But Kind of Love It](https://insignificantgamer.blog/posts/i-hate-ai-but-kind-of-love-it/)

I've been pretty busy as of late trying to get this up and running, but it is now, for the most part, officially finished... Well, I'll give it a 95% complete status with another 5% being minor things here and there that I may or may not want to even worry about.

## What Happened

So, I caught wind about some new blog websites that were focusing entirely on minimalism, something I am very fond of. Well, when it comes to this... not businesses and brands. A couple examples would be [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev) or [Mataroa](https://mataroa.blog); simple, unbloated, no ads, no distractions - just you and the text. Lo and behold, my friend had just recently started using Bear Blog and that honestly encouraged me even more to contemplate leaving [Ghost](https://ghost.org), a headless content management system that was a little too much fluff and not enough... simplicity. I also didn't care for the markdown system a whole lot; it left a lot to be desired after I had been working with Obsidian and Visual Studio Code's markdown syntax.

From there, further research lead me to another type of website: static site generators. This eventually brought me to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) which I finally settled on as the (hopefully) final destination of my blog. The reason for this migration was pretty simple: I would have all the control. I also would save money, but that's just a bonus on top of being able to do anything I could ever want with my blog using a template and limited by the extent of my capabilities. Now, while I was discovering these new things, I was unaware that Ghost can be used with static site generators, but at this point I was fully commited to a transition, thus this wonderful new place I call my own that I've been building for the past couple weeks.

## Explanation of this New Place

There's some stark differences from this website compared to my previous Ghost website, but it's generally all still pretty straight forward when it comes to a webpage. Some key differences though would be my use of social media links if you wish to follow me there (I don't use them really, except to post my blog posts there), a new way to subscribe to a newsletter, and an easy way to also get my posts delivered directly to your favorite RSS Reader.

- __Comments__: You can now leave comments down at the bottom of every post as well as leaving emoticons, but with a caveat. Since this is a service is a free and open-source service through Github, if you want to leave a comment or emoji you have to sign in through Github. This may change at a later time, but most peope won't be leaving comments.

- __Subscribing__: Simply click on the big blue "Subscribe" button on the sidebar of the main page or the "Subscribe" text in the Menu section of any page to be redirected to a subscription form. Here you can sign up for a newsletter that will send you an email whenever I post something new. Now, the email will only give you a small excerpt of my posts, so if you want to read the entirety of the content, you'll need to visit the website.

- __RSS__: If you want to view the entirety of my posts without having to visit my site then you'll want to copy/paste the RSS link into your favorite RSS Reader. If you don't know what that is, it's essentially a program that you curate with only news and posts you want to see. Some popular readers for iOS are "feeeed" and "NetNewsWire", and some popular ones for Android are "Feeder" and "Inoreader". If you read a lot of content then I highly recommend getting an RSS Reader and then curating what you want to read to your liking.

- __Tags__: Each article I write I will give specific labels that I feel are appropriate to their contents. Use this page to read similar articles.

- __Fellow Writers__: In here I list off other blogs that I would recommend and also resources that I find helpful for either Tabletop games and other similar content.

- __My Mods__: A quick page to look at to see some things I've created or developed for video games.

- __Search__ (On the home page): Current work in progress and debating if I actually want it.
