# My Mods & Projects

Here are the mods and projects I've created or contributed to.

## Vintage Story Mods

- [Automated Server Messages](https://mods.vintagestory.at/automatedservermessages) - I had a need to have messages trigger to inform players if a server restart was imminent. None of the code is mine as Claude and ChatGPT created it all, I merely had the idea.

## Barotrauma

*My best designs thus far*
- [![The Mantle](/images/mods/the-mantle-thumb.jpg)](/images/mods/the-mantle-thumb.jpg) - My latest submarine design using all that I have learned from my previous subs.

- [![The Hermadin](/images/mods/the-hermadin-thumb.jpg)](/images/mods/the-hermadin-thumb.jpg) - A vessel I started, forgot about, revisited and finished as quick as possible just for the sake of having it be completed. It's still advanced compared to my other subs, just might have a lot of mistakes.

## Avorion

*My best designs thus far*
- [Tempest-Class Cruiser]( - A massive vessel that surprisingly had less than 3,000 blocks, is sleek, and spacious enough for many future upgrades.

- [Crusader-Class Destroyer]( - A quad-nacelle ship with plenty of potential firepower.

- [Arbalest-Class Frigate]( - An early-game vessel you can build fairly cheaply and it'll last until at least the mid-game.

- [Vigilant-Class Corvette, MK-2]() - Updated version of my beginner vessel.
