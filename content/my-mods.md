# My Mods & Projects

Here are the mods and projects I've created or contributed to.

## Vintage Story Mods

[Automated Server Messages](https://mods.vintagestory.at/automatedservermessages)

I had a need to have messages trigger to inform players if a server restart was imminent. None of the code is mine as Claude and ChatGPT created it all, I merely had the idea.

## Barotrauma

### The Hermadin
[![The Hermadin](/images/mods/hermadin-thumb.jpg)](/images/mods/hermadin-thumb.jpg)

A vessel I started, forgot about, revisited and finished as quick as possible just for the sake of having it be completed. It's still advanced compared to my other subs, just might have a lot of mistakes.

## Avorion

*My best designs thus far*

### Tempest-Class Cruiser
[![Tempest-Class Cruiser](/images/mods/tempest-thumb.jpg)](/images/mods/tempest-thumb.jpg)

A massive vessel that surprisingly had less than 3,000 blocks, is sleek, and spacious enough for many future upgrades.

### Crusader-Class Destroyer
- [![Crusader-Class Destroyer](/images/mods/crusader-thumb.jpg)](/images/mods/crusader-thumb.jpg)

A quad-nacelle ship with plenty of potential firepower.

### Arbalest-Class Frigate
- [![Arbalest-Class Frigate](/images/mods/arbalest-thumb.jpg)](/images/mods/arbalest-thumb.jpg)

An early-game vessel you can build fairly cheaply and it'll last until at least the mid-game.
