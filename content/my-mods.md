# My Mods & Projects

Here are a few of the mods and projects I've created or contributed to. Really these are just designs rather than actual coding to form a coherent modification to a game.

## Vintage Story Mods

[Automated Server Messages](https://mods.vintagestory.at/automatedservermessages)

I had a need to have messages trigger to inform players if a server restart was imminent. None of the code is mine as Claude and ChatGPT created it all, I merely had the idea.

A vessel I started, forgot about, revisited and finished as quick as possible just for the sake of having it be completed. It's still advanced compared to my other subs, just might have a lot of mistakes.

A massive vessel that surprisingly had less than 3,000 blocks, is sleek, and spacious enough for many future upgrades.

An early-game vessel you can build fairly cheaply and it'll last until at least the mid-game.
