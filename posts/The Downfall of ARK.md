 If you play video games at all you've more or less heard about ARK: Survival Evolved. 
(Exposite further here for the above sentence)
If you're a survival-crafting genre loving nutcase like myself, you've more than likely played the absolute hell out of this game and completely loved it despite its bad optimization, general jankiness, and Studio Wildcard's seemingly lack of care to fix the multitude of bugs and instead opting to create more paid DLC.
