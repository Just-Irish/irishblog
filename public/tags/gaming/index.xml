      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Forever Winter&lt;/em&gt;, developed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fundogstudios.com/&#34;&gt;Fun Dog Studios&lt;/a&gt;, recently entered Early Access on Steam and the Epic Game Store on September 24th. This is an extraction shooter not like any other that you have played as it takes a completely different approach to the genre. It maintains the same aspect of what you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with when it comes to an extraction-shooter: enter a raid, collect loot, and get the fuck out - but what makes it different from its peers is that you are absolutely not a hero, you are not a badass, you are not important whatsoever, and you are not meant to survive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
