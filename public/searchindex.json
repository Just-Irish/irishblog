[{"content":" Our Forever War; A Collection of Journals and First-hand Accounts of the Start of the Apocalypse From the journal of Lieutenant Arthur Bennett, 1st Coldstream Guards Are you familiar with the feeling of all the hairs on the back of your neck standing up? What about the numbness after sitting in an uncomfortable position for too long? Imagine those feelings, but so much greater, beginning in your chest and spreading throughout your body in a single instant. Everybody felt it at the exact same time that day, and we were woefully unaware of its meaning until we met Him.\n“I have returned,” he said. We couldn’t believe it. It was Him: Jesus Christ. “Poor are the tidings I bring with my return, for the Battle of Armageddon has begun.”\nIs this why America has gone silent? Is this why ships we send West to the shores of the Americas have never returned?\n“The Son of Perdition has claimed the land to the West.”\nWe had no idea that Jesus’ return would be so catastrophic. Months later we would receive word that Jerusalem had fallen. Jerusalem, the holiest of cities, conquered. Jesus would address us one last time:\n“My children. I have been striken with the most oppressive of pains. I must meet The Beast in battle for control of Jerusalem. Upon meeting my opposite my strength will be bound within mortal limits. My promise of paradise through faith must falter for there to be victory. Fret not for through faith I promise rebirth until the day of triumph.”\nIt took no time for scholars and religious leaders to agree upon what Christ had said: there would be no Heaven, only a repetition of life on Earth, until some victory that is achieved that we cannot begin to understand. Why should we continue with faith if faith gave us broken promises?\nMonths later after Christ’s departure from England, a towering creature landed on our shores. We were nothing more than roaches in its shadow. Our weapons, artillery… it did nothing. And thus it began its annihilation of London.\nWe fought and fought. Thousands died. We could do nothing except cause it the inconvenience of a mosquito to an elephant. That’s when the sky cracked, blue streaks of lightning arced across the city and we all saw a figure, a human, slam into the Nephilim.\nA fight ensued between the two that seemed forever, but only a matter of minutes had actually passed. It was glorious and absolutely terrifying. The human won as a small handheld object cratered the skull of the giant, but the beast immediately began burning. The winds began to pick up, a storm out of no where, and the titan exploded as it fell into a red dust-like inferno.\nThose of us nearby were enveloped in a sandstorm like never before seen. Mere meters away we began colliding with otherworldly forces. We fought our way from where the Nephilim died in hopes that we could escape the grainy torrent that hid these terrifying beasts.\nA crack of lightning struck near us and there stood a man, warhammer in hand, becoming a wall between us and the horse-sized horned beast that was upon us. The man whipped his hammer and hit the beast with a thunderous crack and the sheer force caused it to disintegrate into a burst of gore and viscera. And then the man who had just saved our group from certain death was gone. But we could now see the edge of the red cloud and parts of an unscathed London, soldiers beyond in a defensive posture.\nFrom there we erected fortifications along the edge. Many were killed as hellspawn wandered into our world. Some made it beyond the city and, even with our best trackers, vanished into our wilds to prey on travelers, farmers, and any other unfortunate enough to stumble upon them. This became our normalcy.\nWelcome This here is the start of my steampunk-themed apocalypse tabletop game. With some encouragement, this all came together during one of my many many boring days at work. First, small themes I found interesting, then lore and truths about the world I wanted to create began to meld.\nGeneral Information I still have a lot of work to do before the first session can begin, but here is a list of things that I have decided upon that I will continue to add to as I think of them:\nGame system I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen for this is Basic Roleplaying (i.e. Call of Cthulu). A straightforward d100 system that doesn\u0026rsquo;t turn the game into a number-heavy strategy game, but also isn\u0026rsquo;t lacking some genuine depth.\nFoundryVTT will be used for dice-rolling, character sheets, and dungeon crawling.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t meant to be a campaign, but moreso an easy one/two-session mission type of game.\nThe old pantheons are real; Thor, Odin, Osiris, Zeus, Raa\u0026hellip;\nTheme of the game is a steampunk/clockwork-style mixed with real-world locations that takes place approximately 100-200 years after the late 1800s. The world has been ravaged by endless war between Humans, Angels, and Demons.\nReincarnation exists, and there\u0026rsquo;s a possibility you rememeber parts of your last life.\nAugmentations of the body is possible using Angelic or Infernal essence.\nYour character is a member of a mercenary guild known as The Penitent Guard; the poor, the forgotten, criminals, and those willing to face absolute horror just to have a home and food at the end of the day find themselves here.\nOther major mercenary guilds are:\nThe Seraphic Blades: An elite, oath-bound order wielding perfected essence augments. They are revered and feared, answering only to sanctioned city-governance and ecclesiastical authorities. The Covenant of Iron: Engineers turned knights. Their armor is clockwork, their weapons experimental, their philosophy utilitarian. They often hold the wall-lines during Rift surges.

This post is mostly to get my very first subscription newsletter sent out to inform you of my website\u0026rsquo;s migration to a new host and new domain name. Be sure to check out my most recent post as only those who received it directly from me have seen it: I Hate AI, But Kind of Love It\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been pretty busy as of late trying to get this up and running, but it is now, for the most part, officially finished\u0026hellip; Well, I\u0026rsquo;ll give it a 95% complete status with another 5% being minor things here and there that I may or may not want to even worry about.\nWhat Happened So, I caught wind about some new blog websites that were focusing entirely on minimalism, something I am very fond of. Well, when it comes to this\u0026hellip; not businesses and brands. A couple examples would be Bear Blog or Mataroa; simple, unbloated, no ads, no distractions - just you and the text. Lo and behold, my friend had just recently started using Bear Blog and that honestly encouraged me even more to contemplate leaving Ghost, a headless content management system that was a little too much fluff and not enough\u0026hellip; simplicity. I also didn\u0026rsquo;t care for the markdown system a whole lot; it left a lot to be desired after I had been working with Obsidian and Visual Studio Code\u0026rsquo;s markdown syntax.\nFrom there, further research lead me to another type of website: static site generators. This eventually brought me to Hugo which I finally settled on as the (hopefully) final destination of my blog. The reason for this migration was pretty simple: I would have all the control. I also would save money, but that\u0026rsquo;s just a bonus on top of being able to do anything I could ever want with my blog using a template and limited by the extent of my capabilities. Now, while I was discovering these new things, I was unaware that Ghost can be used with static site generators, but at this point I was fully commited to a transition, thus this wonderful new place I call my own that I\u0026rsquo;ve been building for the past couple weeks.\nExplanation of this New Place There\u0026rsquo;s some stark differences from this website compared to my previous Ghost website, but it\u0026rsquo;s generally all still pretty straight forward when it comes to a webpage. Some key differences though would be my use of social media links if you wish to follow me there (I don\u0026rsquo;t use them really, except to post my blog posts there), a new way to subscribe to a newsletter, and an easy way to also get my posts delivered directly to your favorite RSS Reader.\nComments: You can now leave comments down at the bottom of every post as well as leaving emoticons, but with a caveat. Since this is a service is a free and open-source service through Github, if you want to leave a comment or emoji you have to sign in through Github. This may change at a later time, but most peope won\u0026rsquo;t be leaving comments.\nSubscribing: Simply click on the big blue \u0026ldquo;Subscribe\u0026rdquo; button on the sidebar of the main page or the \u0026ldquo;Subscribe\u0026rdquo; text in the Menu section of any page to be redirected to a subscription form. Here you can sign up for a newsletter that will send you an email whenever I post something new. Now, the email will only give you a small excerpt of my posts, so if you want to read the entirety of the content, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to visit the website.\nRSS: If you want to view the entirety of my posts without having to visit my site then you\u0026rsquo;ll want to copy/paste the RSS link into your favorite RSS Reader. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what that is, it\u0026rsquo;s essentially a program that you curate with only news and posts you want to see. Some popular readers for iOS are \u0026ldquo;feeeed\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;NetNewsWire\u0026rdquo;, and some popular ones for Android are \u0026ldquo;Feeder\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Inoreader\u0026rdquo;. If you read a lot of content then I highly recommend getting an RSS Reader and then curating what you want to read to your liking.\nTags: Each article I write I will give specific labels that I feel are appropriate to their contents. Use this page to read similar articles.\nFellow Writers: In here I list off other blogs that I would recommend and also resources that I find helpful for either Tabletop games and other similar content.\nMy Mods: A quick page to look at to see some things I\u0026rsquo;ve created or developed for video games.\nSearch (On the home page): Current work in progress and debating if I actually want it.\n","date":"10 December, 2025","id":1,"permalink":"/posts/my-website-migration/","summary":"A simple explanation for my new wesite.","tags":"important website all-posts","title":"My Website Migration"},{"content":"Subscribe to stay updated with new posts from me!

I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, some of you weirdos out there are so far removed from normal societal behaviors that normal people not wanting to interact with you is wholly deserving. It\u0026rsquo;s like watching a meth addict try to be normal in society - they can\u0026rsquo;t - and they\u0026rsquo;ve done that to themselves. Just like you weirdies marrying the AI on your damn phone\u0026hellip; I can\u0026rsquo;t begin to comprehend the mental process. This is not my declaration of war against you, not at all; I\u0026rsquo;ll be your friend, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to let you know you\u0026rsquo;re really fucking weird and that it is wrong and that I\u0026rsquo;m slightly uncomfortable.\nWell, enough with that tangent.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ve Used AI For I\u0026rsquo;ve been using AI quite extensively as of late to assist me with many things. For instance, this blog. Not being fluent in html or understanding Hugo - which is what this blog is - was impedeing me from fleshing out the site the way I wanted it. So, I used Claude to help me fill in the blanks. Now I have a blog that is almost as minimal as a painted stone\u0026hellip; If I wanted an unpainted stone for a blog I\u0026rsquo;d probably have chosen bearblog.dev or mataroa.blog; WYSIWYG. Honestly perfectly simple and more sites should be like those.\nSo the AI Claude helped me design this blog to my liking, and I also used it for my Vintage Story mod. There was absolutely no way in hell I\u0026rsquo;d be able to create it by myself. I don\u0026rsquo;t know any C# (pronounced C-sharp, if you\u0026rsquo;re unaware), which is approximately 95% of the mod, but there was Claude who does know all of this and, with some ideas written down, away Claude went! It\u0026hellip; it took me so long to actually finish the mod, though. Claude was running around with outdated information on Vintage Story, so there were some major hiccups needing circumventing, and also lots of trial and error. Now, if I just knew C# it\u0026rsquo;s possible I\u0026rsquo;d have figured out the issues quicker, but that\u0026rsquo;s up for debate.\nThen I have all my ideas for my tabletop campaign I want to run. That\u0026rsquo;s where ChatGPT came in. All these ideas, but no idea where to start and how to flesh out the information. So I started by making key features, facts, and people in my world and, as I started to do that, new ideas would be born. Then I\u0026rsquo;d hit send and ChatGPT would respond with, \u0026ldquo;Oh my, you\u0026rsquo;re just so freaking amazing, these ideas are SO amazing, blah, blah, blah.\u0026rdquo; ChatGPT is such an annoying kissass\u0026hellip;\nChatGPT helped extensively with compiling my information into a well-structured comprehensive form and, as expected, also making mistakes trying to understand my incoherent ramblings which would then turn out to actually be a pleasant idea I want to incorporate.\nAlongside all of that, ChatGPT was able to create images reflecting what I was envisioning for certain aspects of my game which is where we begin to enter the questionable territory of AI use.\nThe Grey Area of AI Use The problem with AI is that it has to learn from somewhere and the easiest place to do so is the entirety of the internet. I don\u0026rsquo;t know the intricacies of how AI gathers its information, but I have to assume that it is mostly no-holds-barred and AI slithers into every little nook and cranny getting every snippet of ones and zeros it could possibly get its little metaphysical hands wrapped around.\nBecause of that we have had multiple situations where AI is creating art from copyrighted material. Hundreds, if not thousands, of artists have come out claiming they have been wronged and showing the receipts as proof. What took them hours, days, or even years to create or master had now been done or surpassed by this thinking machine in a matter of minutes, completely making the artist kind of irrelevent.\nSo at what point is AI okay to use? Personally, I think AI should be used, but with the caveat that whomever uses it must inform the public that whatever it is they created is not 100% genuine. So if an artist who uses AI creates something, they absolutely need to say, \u0026ldquo;Hey, I created this useing AI.\u0026rdquo; With that information shared the public can now look at it and make proper critiques, but, more importantly, know that wahtever was created might have a copy/pasted influence.\nI also believe that whenever AI is used in this way the AI automatically, or upon request, provide its sources for \u0026ldquo;inspiration\u0026rdquo;; you know, a sort of, \u0026ldquo;Ah yeah, I pulled this from the Mona Lisa by Leonardo de Vinci, I copied this from a digital picture of Bob Ross\u0026rsquo; haircut\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; When we get into someone trying to sell a product, for instance, this sourced information needs to be on that label like the warning labels of electrical grooming devices.\nWhy I Hate AI This part is quite simple: it makes people lazy as hell, a lot of people who use it are not genuine, and it saps creativity.\nI am a perfect example of AI making people lazy as hell. My C# Vintage Story mod? I can learn that. The images I had processed for my TTRPG? I can learn to draw exactly what I want. But I don\u0026rsquo;t; AI has made it so quick and easy to do things you yourself cannot do. And that sucks. There\u0026rsquo;s no better feeling than learning a craft, putting your knowledge and developed skills to the test, and creating something from nothing. But damn do I just want these things right now\u0026hellip;\nI had ChatGPT put together a \u0026ldquo;back-of-a-book\u0026rdquo; type summary based on all the key points of my TTRPG campaign I\u0026rsquo;m slowly accumulating material for and, while it hit all the beats and gave it a Hollywood-esque flair, it still didn\u0026rsquo;t feel right. When you read it, I can only compare it to sounding ironically robotic (did I use that right?). But after getting some time to do it myself, when I wrote it out\u0026hellip; I took a different approach. It\u0026rsquo;s a summary hidden within a first-hand account of events within the world and, while I\u0026rsquo;m not that great of a writer, you can feel the energy better; and you can definitely tell a human wrote it!\nNow I will always tell you if I used AI for something. I have my own sense of honor and dignity that I must fulfill and I cannot bear the shame of presenting something as my own when it most certainly is not. Well, there\u0026rsquo;s a significant portion of the world that simply could care less about such things and are sweeping the web with what has become known as \u0026ldquo;AI Slop\u0026rdquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to use YouTube for this example and I\u0026rsquo;m sure you know why. YouTube is consumed in a deluge of this AI slop and you cannot escape it. People are out there making these videos - documentaries - by the day, establishing a fanbase, and are outshining genuine content creators who are actually putting in all the work and have been doing it for years only to be surpassed by a fake. It\u0026rsquo;s horrible. And that fanbase of the AI channel for the most part has no idea it\u0026rsquo;s AI since, well, there\u0026rsquo;s no disclosure.\nWhat makes it even worse is that since these AI scripted videos are churned out like the McNuggets from the McDonald\u0026rsquo;s factory line, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of potential for error. And because of that, videos that are selling themselves as distributing factual information, these unaware fans will only consume thinking that there is nothing false being fed to them. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s on the internet; it must be true.\nI was half-assed listening to a video that auto-played the other day that is a perfect example. The video was about Soviet generals critiquing the American XM1 tank (prototype M1 Abrams). It started delving into Soviet tactics that was meant to show why the XM1 would be garbage compared to the oh-so-perfect T-72 main battle tank: the Deep Battle doctrine. This is a very real doctrine that the USSR theorized and developed in the 1920s and \u0026rsquo;30s, but didn\u0026rsquo;t get to use it until the end of World War II. It had some similarities to Nazi Germany\u0026rsquo;s Blitzkrieg, but differed fundamentally. The video I was listening to instead says, \u0026quot;Deep Battle\u0026rsquo; was a brutal and elegant evolution of the Blitzkrieg tactics that HAD crushed Germany.\u0026quot;\nQuote Providing Context to the Deep Battle Doctrine (Click to Expand) Indeed, by the early 1930s, the concept of glubokaya operatsiya, or deep operations, had become enshrined in Soviet doctrine and training. Tying new emerging technologies of aircraft, tanks, and motorization together with the idea of using large-scale mobile forces (Fronts) on separate axes of operations in the enemy’s rear, deep operations looked to disrupt rather than simply destroy the enemy’s defence. The Soviets put this doctrine to good use, particularly in 1944 and 1945. Faced with large-scale offensives on widely separated fronts, the Germans were unable to be strong at every point, and the cohesion of the overall German defence broke down. -DR HUW J. DAVIES and DR ROBERT T. FOLEY\nAnyone who has expressed some interest in the history of World War II will be familiar with Blitzkrieg and will know that Blitzkrieg was the strategy Nazi Germany used in the 1940s campaign against Western Europe, NOT the tactics used to defeat Germany. This is such a fundamental screw up it\u0026rsquo;s embarrassing and the people who are not aware will take the video\u0026rsquo;s information as fact and then repeat it in conversation later on. Now, this isn\u0026rsquo;t as big of a problem as I\u0026rsquo;m making it out to be since we have so much historical knowledge, books, documents, and, while few now, witnesses of World War II that anyone who makes this blunder can easily be corrected and shown the proof. The main issues are the fact that people, first of all, assume AI can\u0026rsquo;t make mistakes even though it\u0026rsquo;s clearly written at the bottom of ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s page - ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info - but secondly, the AI written script made a big mistake that nobody seems to have caught.\nIt Can be Good or Bad; Depends on Who You Are I\u0026rsquo;ve ranted long enough about this. Fact of the matter is that AI can be both beneficial and detrimental for people and society. And like anything else in this world those with honor and integrity will use it for fun or to actually make a difference, and those who could care less and have no shame will use it for all the despicable reasons you can think of. AI is now our world and we need to get used to it and we need to be able to spot it. You can spot AI and I highly encourage you to watch the video I link down below because we need to be able to recognize it and we need to call out the bullshit like a person would a snakeoil salesman.\n","date":"23 November, 2025","id":3,"permalink":"/posts/i-hate-ai-but-kind-of-love-it/","summary":"I break down my love/hate relationship with AI and how people just suck.","tags":"ramblings random observations AI all-posts","title":"I Hate AI, but Kind of Love It"},{"content":"\nFor quite a few years now video games have been on a downward spiral. The shareholders and upper management have been pushing for their next payday and the developers have been pushing product after product seemingly with the same enthusiasm as an ant within its colony only to be cast aside when there\u0026rsquo;s no more use for them. The inevitable outcome is a game delivered unimaginative, spiritless, and more than likely broken; all the while it was touted by journalists and trailers at conventions as the \u0026ldquo;next big thing\u0026rdquo;. So, ultimately, you\u0026rsquo;re handed a shit-sandwich sprinkled with gold flakes sourced from someone\u0026rsquo;s expelled detritus after a night of consuming Goldschläger. But hey, the bread looks good; that\u0026rsquo;s all that matters, right?\nWith this becoming the norm, people, but more specifically gamers such as myself, have become increasingly critical and wary, perhaps overly so in some, if not most, instances.\nWell, recently the new(ish) studio Build a Rocket Boy (BARB) came onto the scene finally releasing their first IP MindsEye after approximately 8 years in development. It took no time at all for the game and studio to be torn a new rear end by most people. Even popular gaming journalism sites like GamesRadar are throwing shade at BARB\u0026rsquo;s game.\nFor Full GamesRadar Review Click Here\nThe first major mistake was the studio deciding to use Epic Games Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). This game engine has been the bane of all video games recently released in the past couple years. Games using the engine run horribly even on brand new \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; hardware and look even worse than games released 15 years ago. But, according to some people online, that\u0026rsquo;s merely because the developers don\u0026rsquo;t know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing with the engine and it\u0026rsquo;s code. Well, if that\u0026rsquo;s the case, this makes *BARB *and all the other studios using UE5 look even worse and UE5 actually the victim rather than a source.\nSo MindsEye has terrible performance due to UE5 demanding a quantum processor, is predisposed to look bad due to UE5\u0026rsquo;s blurry visuals and blinding lighting, and - at the fault of the gaming community - was thought to be an equivalent to Grand Theft Auto due to how the game was presented and also the founder of BARB, Leslie Benzies, previously having worked on most GTA games as a producer. While the comparisons can be expected, they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have dictated the gaming communities hype. All these factors ultimately boil into a nice steaming disappointment soup. And this is the problem. Now, I\u0026rsquo;m not about to say BARB and other studios are not at fault, they very much are, but I believe that we, too, are also at fault.\nBARB came out on social media and stated that they are \u0026ldquo;heartbroken\u0026rdquo; that players are not able to enjoy their game as it was intended and, honestly, my first reaction was dismiss their apology as another parroted damage control press conference type of situation because of how I have programmed myself to respond to these things.\nhttps://t.co/2JFNBQnsAK\n\u0026mdash; MindsEye (@MindsEyeGame) June 12, 2025 But what if it isn\u0026rsquo;t? What if they\u0026rsquo;re genuine and really are bothered that they delivered a product that under-delivered and cannot be enjoyed? Is it possible that our knee-jerk reactions to these new studios - or small if you\u0026rsquo;re indie - could be too much and could possibly kill something great before it could be fully realized? I don\u0026rsquo;t know, I\u0026rsquo;m a cynic; I already believe it\u0026rsquo;s just a facade. No Man\u0026rsquo;s Sky is one game that comes to mind that was extremely under-delivered and, as of today, sits at a Very Positive 82% review rating according to SteamDB and it is personally one of my favorite games to revisit and get lost in. Granted, it took a minimum of 5 years to get to where it should have been, but it did recover, and recover like a god it did.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not going to touch on peoples claims that the game is genuinely garbage as I\u0026rsquo;ve no interest in buying or playing this game, this is just a bunch of hypotheticals and food for thought of when I saw the immediate backlash online to a game and studio I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know existed. I do kind of miss not being so critical and just enjoying games for what they were, but the industry made me this way.\nSources and Links GamesRadar Review\nLeslie Benzies\nMindsEyeGame X Post\nNo Mans Sky SteamDB\n","date":"17 June, 2025","id":4,"permalink":"/posts/are-new-developers-caught-in-the-crosshairs-of-todays-gamers/","summary":"Watching news about the developer Build a Rocket Boy about their apparently horrible game MindsEye got me wondering if us gamers have become too damn critical...

I was listening to YouTube like I usually do; sometimes allowing videos to auto-play due to apathy, clicking on a title or image that somewhat caught my interest, or actually seeking out the specific content that I needed. I needed something to kind of soothe my soul and I stumbled across a video that had a title along the lines of \u0026ldquo;When Cartoon Character\u0026rsquo;s Gave Us a Reality Check\u0026rdquo; and the thumbnail was that of Uncle Iroh from Avatar: The Last Airbender. Uncle Iroh being one of my favorite characters and mentors from any cartoon, I clicked on the video.\nThere were scenes from shows and movies that can be described as life-coach advice: Master Oogway from Kung Fu Panda speaking about past, future and present; Uncle Iroh - of course - speaking to Aang about life, tunnels and light; and a couple others. One of those scenes spliced into the eight minute dreary-tuned self-reflection mood-booster was that of a cartoon I never heard of. After a bit of search-engine magic I discovered it to be the show Final Space. Here\u0026rsquo;s the kicker, though: what really pulled me in was the fact one of the characters was voiced by Ron Perlman. Well, also the part where the other character was having an all-too-familiar internal conflict with himself - self-doubt - but hey! Big daddy Perlman, papa Hellboy, Mr. War-Never-Changes. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist, thus started my new small obsession.\nThere was a major problem, though: Final Space officially doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist anymore. You can\u0026rsquo;t find the show on any streaming services like Hulu - or even YouTube which is notorious for having nearly everything - or store shelves if physical media is something you partake in. After some research into its disappearance, because I needed to know what this show was and I needed it now, I discovered that Adult Swim cut it as a tax write-off due to the proposed merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc. Three seasons of Final Space vanished with a simple signature leaving the creator, Olan Rogers, visibly upset in videos he uploaded to address the sudden end for fans; and fans of course dismayed with no way to enjoy them again.\nThat didn\u0026rsquo;t stop me, though. There are ways if you know how to look. Or you can buy the series off eBay, which I only discovered while writing this.\nWhat Is Final Space? The whole premise is pretty straight forward and digestible and we get some really great voice acting from a talented cast like David Tennant (Dr. Who), Steven Yeun (The Walking Dead), Claudia Black (Stargate SG:1), and Keith David (Arbiter from Halo) to name a few. Where Family Guy, South Park and Bob\u0026rsquo;s Burgers are episodic, Final Space is a story about the insignificant individual Gary Goodspeed being thrust from government-issued incarceration to hero of the universe. But it\u0026rsquo;s not strictly him. Final Space is also about the crew Gary manages to assemble with luck, promises, and similar goals.\nSince I had watched that snippet from the YouTube video I mentioned earlier, I knew that the show wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to always be funny. Final Space immediately starts with a melancholic melody and the scenes flashing on the screen are letting you know the situation is severe. The whole show continuously reminds you that even though characters do dumb things - laugh, giggle, piss (literally, more on that later) - bad things happen. They care, they cry, they yell, they fight amongst themselves, they make difficult decisions. And they die.\nThe show does suffer in a lot of areas, though. It\u0026rsquo;s not all sunshine and cookies. Season 1 hits really well minus a couple plot points, a couple character choices, and the fact that it couldn\u0026rsquo;t establish characters very well being only ten episodes long. Season 2, on the other hand, gets really bad. It is still* good*, it just gets really bad. I know that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, so bear with me.\nThe Bad The executives started interfereing with the show, suggesting that Season 2 be less serialized and focus more on humor and comic relief. You know, like American Dad. Side plots are skimmed at best. Some of the side plots begin to build and the writing appears to make them important or relevant to a character\u0026rsquo;s growth or contribute to the main story. Instead, they\u0026rsquo;re finished off for a cheap joke. Infantilism. Remember the \u0026ldquo;Piss\u0026rdquo; I mentioned earlier? Yeah. This is a spoiler, but I\u0026rsquo;m letting this one rip due to how much I genuinely hate the gag. Episode 2 starts off with the crew having some problems with one another and their personal spaces, so, like animals, decide to start pissing on everything to \u0026ldquo;claim\u0026rdquo; territory. But\u0026hellip; that\u0026rsquo;s not all. It turns into a Super Soaker piss fight\u0026hellip; This whole segment didn\u0026rsquo;t need to exist as it really brings down the mood that Season 1 built up so well. Plot inconsistencies and character development take a hit. One of the characters has an absolutely horrible traumatizing experience that, after then end of the episode, never comes up again nor is it reflected. Severe isn\u0026rsquo;t severe. Something really bad happen? Deus ex machina\u0026hellip; The writing diminishes very important plot points. I chalk this up to bullet point numero uno. The Good Gary\u0026rsquo;s personality improves from season 1 starting with the first episode. Where in the first season he is very thespian and inappropriate, Redditors point out that the trauma from season 1 matures him or his obvious insanity subsides once he has proper face-to-face interactions. Personally, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind the dramatics - I actually miss it - but I do mind a character relaying very serious information and then Gary slipping in \u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s pretty dark. Like midnight dark. The darkest of the dark.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s a real quote\u0026hellip; and it saps away the gravity of the situation. That\u0026rsquo;s it. I have nothing else other than it is still very much Final Space. If there wasn\u0026rsquo;t any of the bad, then it\u0026rsquo;d be season 1 quality with a better Gary. Season 3, thankfully, is a most welcome return to form. Gary keeps his season 2 maturity but the episodic nature is gone along with any sort of infantilism, though there are still plot inconsistencies and side plots could still use some work. From here we get much needed character development that lacked in season 2: relationships flourish and disintegrate, friendships are tested, characters are brought to their lowest points and we have to watch them swim in despair while trying not to lose themselves. This season gets very dark.\nThe Faces of Gary; Suave - Grief - Anger\nUnfortunately, season 3 ends up leaving us with a cliffhanger and this is where fans are most frustrated. Fortunately, for us, Olan Rogers pestered TBS enough and was given permission to finish Final Space as a graphic novel. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that weird? He is given permission to finish his creation\u0026hellip; One mans dream is another corporations tax write-off. Anyways, once I learned that bit of information I jumped on it. Can\u0026rsquo;t wait to get the book so I can see it to the end. When a show continually evokes emotional responses from me, I believe we have something good here that needs to be shared. It\u0026rsquo;s not a long watch. You can binge all three seasons in a day if you can get your hands on it.\nOlan I think does a really good job with his writing as there are so many great quotes and bits of dialogue strewn throughout like, \u0026ldquo;Traps are just open casting calls for heroes\u0026rdquo;. I title this \u0026ldquo;A Rough Gem\u0026rdquo; because I believe if Final Space were to ever re-release and have the edges ground and polished, we could have something pretty amazing, vastly outshining all the slop we currently mill about in. While we don\u0026rsquo;t have Final Space anymore, Olan has worked on another project besides the graphic novel. Another show that he is getting funded for through Kickstarter. I\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and link it below. The art style is a drastic change to Final Space\u0026rsquo;s and a welcome one. Be forewarned: there is a depiction of suicide. Also, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder if this is a sort of continuation of Final Space. You would have to watch the series to understand. Salvation comes in the blink of an eye.\n","date":"15 December, 2024","id":5,"permalink":"/posts/final-space-a-rough-gem-in-a-sea-of-mediocrity/","summary":"After finishing the series I had to come share my thoughts and criticisms of a fantastic show that I believe more people need to see.","tags":"review good-review tv show cartoon final-space","title":"Final Space- A Rough Gem in a Sea of Mediocrity"},{"content":"Edit I published this before it was ready. Sleep deprivation convinced me I said all that I needed to when really I expounded very little. Anyways, here it is corrected and in its entirity.\n\u0026ldquo;Modernity\u0026rdquo; is a term I like to use as a blanket description for anything that has been designed in a way to streamline and \u0026ldquo;update\u0026rdquo; just about everything. \u0026ldquo;Everything\u0026rdquo; literally being just about anything you can think of. It\u0026rsquo;s everywhere and I despise a lot of it.\nThe world has a current obsession with making all aspects of our life and all the tangible and intangible things efficient. Now, I\u0026rsquo;m not losing my mind and saying \u0026ldquo;Anarchy rules, structure be dammed!\u0026rdquo; Don\u0026rsquo;t worry. We, as a society, need these things - this \u0026ldquo;optimization\u0026rdquo; - for society to work and our sanity to remain in good spirits, especially at our current technological state and our vast ever-booming population. This efficiency that we require prevents the unnecessary loss of our most important currency: time. But there\u0026rsquo;s something we fail to notice as the years go by and we continue to enjoy this facade of extra accumulated time like it\u0026rsquo;s the change we get back after paying in cash: everything appears damn near identical as corporations have opted for a boring, streamlined, cost-effective agenda over a fun, creative, and competitive one. You probably haven\u0026rsquo;t noticed it at all or, if you have, it was so brief the thought slipped away from your mind like all the junk mail you toss into the garbage after a mere glance at the front of the envelope.\nTake note the next time you go out and about. If you visit a Burger King for a quick treat, go to Taco Bell next. They look damn near identical inside, exceptions being the menu and uniforms the employees don. The buildings are perfectly square, painted the same dreary neutral grey; inside everything is so sleek and spacious, a sterile grey, but we all know it\u0026rsquo;s not due to the sheen of the light on the poorly mopped floors. Go into the gas station and visit the refrigerator. Look at all the sodas, canned and bottled. Most are a very simple color with a very basic logo, excluding specialty Mountain Dew since gamers like RGB and some others that actually need to stand out. There\u0026rsquo;s no inspiration, fun, or effort put into the things we interact with on a daily basis anymore. It\u0026rsquo;s all been sapped away for the sake of being \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; and being a quicker way for corporations to have their pockets lined for significantly less effort than before.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t really notice these things until I had it pointed out to me and it genuinely surprised me. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think anything of it. I was still consuming a Coke or Pepsi without noticing that their branding changed to a strict solid colored can, a simplistic logo, and an uninspired font. For example, in 2008 Pepsi had a bubbled, shadowed font and then in 2014 Pepsi decided to change the logo to a flat, thin lower-cased font and its been that way since. One of my favorite sodas to drink growing up was Mr. Pibb and it was for the dumbest reason: the branding was interesting and eye-catching.\nNowadays, Mr. Pibb doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist anymore and hasn\u0026rsquo;t since the late \u0026rsquo;90s as it was replaced by its newer sibling Pibb Extreme. Same taste, just less interesting to look at. At the risk of sounding like I\u0026rsquo;m reminiscing like a boomer would about \u0026ldquo;The good ole days\u0026rdquo;, things before the 2010\u0026rsquo;s were actually interesting.\nI guess you could say this is a bit of a nostalgic vent. I do miss the things I grew up with like the adobe-like building for Taco Bell and its stupid Chihuahua mascot, or the iconic red roof found on Pizza Hut\u0026rsquo;s that had that awesome, comfortable, family-dining like atmosphere on the inside. But my point is everything used to have a uniqueness about them; now everything is the same.\n","date":"7 November, 2024","id":6,"permalink":"/posts/modernity-is-safe-but-very-boring/","summary":"I cover the things that I see and witness over time that seem to change from having its own identity to one that is almost unmistakably the same as another.","tags":"ramblings random deep-thoughts all-posts","title":"Modernity is Safe, but Very Boring"},{"content":"When I turned 16 in 2008 I was quite excited. I was looking forward to all the new opportunities that would be opening up to me. A week before my birthday I started putting in job applications around town, because I needed some goof-off money. And fuel to get around, of course. A grocery store took me in and I started accumulating new friends and that ever-so-sought-after dollar. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t long before I finally went out and got myself an Xbox 360 and, shortly after, a router so I could start gaming with my newfound friends.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know how many times I went into work with a measly 2 hours of sleep after a long night of me and my coworkers, now my best of friends, dunking on people in Halo 3 or Call of Duty Modern Warfare. Or falling asleep standing up with a broom as my crutch after being out at GameStop for that midnight release. This went on for a few years, but as the Earth continued its revolutions things started to die down. The very last game that I remember enjoying with the guys was Battlefield Hardline which released in 2015. Majority of my friends were 4 or more years older than I, so their careers started to demand more of their attention and, with such little time left available, began to pursue other hobbies.\n10 years has passed since our last leaderboard takeover, about 9 years since we ever got together again to game. Promotions have been handed out at work, children have been brought into their lives, and those that are closest to them like family and friends have begun to fill whatever actual free time they have.\nIt took me another 5 years to start this same transformation. At some point during the pandemic a small part of me gave up a form of hope. Well, with how chaotic the 2020\u0026rsquo;s started, most people lost hope in one thing or another, but mine had no relation. The hope that I lost was a product of my constant dissatisfaction with the current status quo of triple A gaming.\nThe triple A game industry has continued to excrete garbage year after year with the only saving graces coming from indie studios or lone developers out there genuinely trying to deliver a magnum opus of sorts or simply something that they are extremely proud of and happy to share with the world.\nResuming the original point; my main hobby of 30 years is slowly starting to wane. Responsibilities of everyday life, meeting expectations of employers, and the demand of my attention for things that don\u0026rsquo;t make my list of priorities; same for you I am sure. I find myself instead of trying out new games I return to what is more familiar and what I believe to actually be worth my time. I no longer - and haven\u0026rsquo;t in many years - want to hang out at GameStop for another midnight release. I would much rather be in the comfort of my home drinking a cup of black tea revisiting a game that has been out for a decade or more.\nSo am I running out of time or just getting old? It\u0026rsquo;s both. The fact of life is that as you age things beyond your control, or within, at times, take a good chunk of the finite time you have available more and more often as the years trickle by. And so with whatever is left over you begin to prioritize whatever means most to you: loved ones, friends, small hobbies that you\u0026rsquo;ve yet to experience, or perfecting a lifelong hobbies like painting. The list could go on.\nI myself have taken up two new hobbies that I never thought I would. One is this crappy blog that probably nobody will read unless I force-feed it to them, which I\u0026rsquo;m fine with, and coffee. I know. \u0026ldquo;Coffee?\u0026rdquo; Yes, coffee. I\u0026rsquo;ve sworn off sodas and energy drinks, so now I\u0026rsquo;m trying my hand at making the perfect cup of coffee and finding the best coffee I can get my hands on, subjectively speaking, and then logging my findings. Never in my life did I think I\u0026rsquo;d spend 15-20 minutes making coffee and writing about it in a notebook.\nOn top of those, I have a list of other hobbies I would like to venture into, but just like all things I can only fit so many avocations in the couple of hours I have left.\n","date":"30 October, 2024","id":7,"permalink":"/posts/out-of-time-or-just-getting-old/","summary":"I briefly cover some thoughts of mine about hobbies and its association with aging.","tags":"ramblings random deep-thoughts all-posts","title":"Out of Time or Just Getting Old"},{"content":"\nEdit I have since beat the game in it\u0026rsquo;s entirety. For a very brief critique of the game, see the last paragraph in this article.\nThe game just released and I am sure most BattleTech fans are curious as to what they can expect from this game. I am not too far into the game; I have finished the tutorial and the first three missions. This here is a quick rundown of what you need to know before purchasing and what you can expect from Mechwarrior 5: Clans.\nBasic Settings Setup Whenever you first start the game it will ask you which control scheme you would like to use: Modern or Classic. Modern streamlines \u0026lsquo;Mech movement to have your \u0026lsquo;Mech move as you would in a first-person shooter. If you move your camera in a direction, your legs do, too. Using \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; keys also act as strafing from side to side.If you are like me and prefer the controls of Mercenaries or Mechwarrior Online, go ahead and choose Classic as your control scheme. Now, this option is not set in stone as you can easily switch between the two in the Gameplay Settings. Also, I have noticed that after closing my game and then relaunching, my hotkeys would reset. While not a huge deal, it can be quite irritating to need to rebind your keys every time after closing the game.\nOnce you get to the main menu you will notice your frames are probably not as good as they should be. A quick adjustment that took me from 30 FPS to 60+ FPS was to enable AMD FSR. I went straight for the Quality preset and everything became so much better. Granted, I do have a much newer GPU, so depending on your hardware you may want to try other presets to get yourself in that sweet spot.\nNow, since I have an AMD card, I cannot speak for NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s DLSS. A quick look online seems to show mixed results using DLSS. Another reported help is to lower Shadows while enabling DLSS.\nGameplay Mechwarrior 5: Clans is very similar to its predecessor Mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries. The \u0026lsquo;Mechs move and function just as they do in the previous title, but there are still improvements warranted from a sequel such as smoother movement, \u0026lsquo;Mech responsiveness from key input, visual fidelity, sound effects, and what have you. Now here is the quick bullet points of the game.\nGame has some light RPG mechanics. As you complete missions you gain experience for both the \u0026lsquo;Mechs chassis type - Kit Fox, Mist Lynx, etc - and the pilots. The experience for the \u0026lsquo;Mechs can be used to increase their maneuverability - such as acceleration/deceleration and torso twist range and speed - as well as purchasing new omni components for the chassis.\nCharacter experience is used to level up their skill. Each pilot has three skills that are the same with the rest of the pilots and then they each have three unique skills to level up.\nTwo types of currency. The two types are Merit and Kerenskies. Both are earned after completing missions, but both purchase different things.\nMerit is used to unlock new \u0026lsquo;Mechs for future purchasing when you reach the appropriate level and, upon doing so, you receive one of that \u0026lsquo;Mech. Merit also allows you to purchase upgrades for your Mechanic, Science, Salvage teams.\nKerenskies, on the other hand, are the Clans C-Bill equivalent; used to actually purchase \u0026lsquo;Mechs once they have been unlocked and other essential \u0026lsquo;Mech components.\nSalvage is not explained, so here. You have three types of salvage: \u0026lsquo;Mech Components, Weapon Components, and Equipment Components. So what is it used for? Research. Which is just a different name for Upgrades. Where \u0026lsquo;Mech experience allows you purchase upgrades for that type of chassis, Salvage purchases are blanket upgrades such as: ER Laser Damage Increase, Machine Gun Range, MASC Cooldown Time, and LBX Autocannon Projectile Speed.\nYour \u0026lsquo;Mech. As far as I can tell, and probably no ones surprise, there are only Clan \u0026lsquo;Mechs available for use. Every level you gain allows you to be able to unlock a new \u0026lsquo;Mech.\nNow for what you probably really want to know about \u0026lsquo;Mechs. \u0026lsquo;Mech loadout is not like that of Mechwarrior Online. Just because you have an energy slot does not mean you can put any type of energy weapon there; you are limited by something called Critical Slots.\nAn ER Medium Laser and an ER Large Laser have a Critical Slot requirement of 1, so these two are interchangeable if you have the available weight to support it, that is. An ER PPC has a requirement of a Critical Slot 2. This is not to be mistaken for how many slots are available to be filled, there is more nuance to it.\nFor example, the Viper has two Critical Slots that are both singular slots. The Adder also has two Critical Slots, but they are combined to create a Critical Slot 2 hardpoint that can house either an ER PPC or one ER Medium/Large Lasers. Yes, even though there are technically two slots there you can still only fit one weapon even if it is smaller.\nAnother thing to note is that you cannot edit your \u0026lsquo;Mechs armor or structure. Whatever the default may be, that is what you are stuck with.\nDifference between Singular and Combined Critical Slots.\nDuring the Missions As expected, the AI is still kind of dumb. I believe it to be improved over Mechwarrior Mercenaries, but it is not exactly in the place that it should be. During one of the missions I came across an enemy Raven perched on a cliff in the distance. While it was within range of me, I was not in range of it. I sat beside a wall shooting it with my ER Pulse Lasers while it moved back and forth on the cliff seemingly not knowing how to reach me. I do not know if that was just a pre-programmed waypoint that it was to follow without deviating or not. I would have to replay the mission to find out.\nSomething that also is not too surprising is the missions are linear. Not just linear, but quite linear. While I know the game was going to be a linear story-driven game, I did not expect the map to update as the mission progressed to block off a route I had just come through with an \u0026ldquo;out of bounds\u0026rdquo; area even though the mission quite literally has me do a u-turn. What does it matter if I go this way or that way around this rock to go right back where I came from?\nNew in this game is the ability to control your Star (Clanner equivalent to the Inner Sphere\u0026rsquo;s Lance). If you are not paying attention opening the command screen can get you killed. That is because you will come to a halt. Now, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it is intended or an oversight, but to counter this hold your movement key (if you play with \u0026ldquo;Throttle Decay\u0026rdquo; on) or set your \u0026lsquo;Mechs speed and then press B (or whatever you decide to set your hotkey to). Doing this will keep your \u0026lsquo;Mech in motion while you tell your Star what to do, but be quick about it or you will run indefinitely into a wall until you close the screen.\nVisuals Visually, the game is quite good. It\u0026rsquo;s not a huge improvement over Mercenaries, but it is enough for me to notice. But this is also a slight problem.\nWhile visually delectable, I noticed that the effects are a bit too grandiose. Explosions, sparks, missile trails and the like can actually greatly hinder your view. If you are a Mechwarrior worth their weight, you focus fire on specific limbs. But with this hindrance it becomes quite difficult to focus fire. I have found myself aiming strictly for the torso because I cannot see, while in Mercenaries I have no problem focus firing an arm or a leg. Now, this is just my thoughts on it, or maybe I am a Mechwarrior not worth his weight. You might be right at home with it and have zero issues.\nImage does not do it justice, but here is a slight example of the VFX blocking my view.\nCutscenes Oh boy. The cinematic cutscenes are a vast improvement over Mercenaries.\nOne thing video games have problems with are the eyes and mouths of characters. While it is not perfect, the eyes are quite good. And the mouths? They are done oh so well. I know, this is an odd thing to praise, but this is how much I appreciate it.\nOne issue that I have, that is not all that major in the grand scheme of things, is that sometimes dialogue sounds ever so slightly robotic. For the most part, though, the voice actors do a swell job. Except for Jayden\u0026rsquo;s voice actor. Something is off about it.\nContributing to greatness of the cutscenes is that Piranha Games used motion capture for the characters and it works so well. No, it is not the greatness that is Activision-Blizzard cinematics, but I think it is damn good for what it is.\nAn early cinematic.\nConclusion As of now, I have nothing to complain about. The game runs well, it looks great, and it plays like I feel it should. What I cannot say is if you should purchase the game or not. I have not finished it yet. Just take this little bit of experience of mine in and use it to help determine if you want the game or not.\nJust remember: this is a linear game with probably no replay value, there\u0026rsquo;s no telling what the modding community will do or capable of for this title, and we don\u0026rsquo;t know what future DLC will look like if that is what is to come.\nCritique After Beating the Game 6.5/10 It\u0026rsquo;s okay. Not bad at all. About 26 hours of enjoyment for a full completion, not counting all of the achievements.I liked the story for the most part; the new interface is a step forward and then step back when compared to Mercenaries; the cinematics were nice to watch and see what a Mechwarrior/BattleTech film could look like; and the voice acting was pretty good for a majority of the characters.What I didn\u0026rsquo;t like was the zero incentive or encouragement to use any \u0026lsquo;Mech that was not your newest unlock, meaning by the end of the game you are actually a disguised Steiner \u0026ldquo;Scout\u0026rdquo; Lance operating Clan \u0026lsquo;Mechs; there\u0026rsquo;s almost not point to the in-game money (I purchased 5 \u0026lsquo;Mechs total, but only 2 \u0026lsquo;Mech types); and the battlefield interface to issue commands was mostly pointless, very rarely did I use it.This game, while I understand why Piranha Games made it separate, should have been a DLC for Mercenaries. The very end of the game foreshadows future DLC, but I would bet that it will be more linear stories if not a continuation of our current Mechwarrior\u0026rsquo;s story. If this had been a DLC for Mercenaries we would have gotten a lot of the Clan \u0026lsquo;Mechs available for use, the awesome Clanner tech, and some of the Clanner factions for the sandbox map as well as new toys for modders to go ham with - not that they need them to do all the great work they already do.\nAll images have been sourced from in-game screenshots I have taken.\n","date":"20 October, 2024","id":8,"permalink":"/posts/before-you-buy-mechwarrior-5-clans/","summary":"A quick and dirty rundown of Mechwarrior 5: Clans after its intial release; not eloquent nor professional in the slightest.","tags":"initial-review gaming video-games mechwarrior battletech all-posts","title":"Before You Buy- Mechwarrior 5 Clans"},{"content":"\nMinecraft is one of those games we\u0026rsquo;ve all grown up either playing or hearing about. It\u0026rsquo;s been a staple in both Gen Z\u0026rsquo;s and Millennial\u0026rsquo;s diet whether they\u0026rsquo;ve known or not as the influences are everywhere. Someone somewhere in your life plays Minecraft, watches their favorite streamer or YouTuber play it, owns toys or Funko Pops, or is eager to see the new Minecraft film.\nBut why is that?\nMinecraft went through multiple test versions in 2009 and throughout that year Notch, the creator, would finally release the Survival version to premium members for a more public Q\u0026amp;A. After two more years of development, Minecraft launched to the public as the Adventure Update, bringing the game to its official 1.0 release on November 18th, 2011.\nThose years, 2009 and 2011, are the two most important years in Minecraft\u0026rsquo;s life as they would determine the two types of Minecraft players for years to come: the \u0026ldquo;Pre-Adventure\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Adventure\u0026rdquo; fans.\nPre-Classic, Classic, Survival Test, Indev, Infdev, Alpha, and Beta are all the major versions that culminates to the Pre-Adventure Minecraft. In this variant of the game there is no experience gain, no hunger, no enchanting; anything that can associate Minecraft to an RPG doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in these versions. Those RPG-like mechanics were all released with the Adventure update and that is exactly where the fanbase diverges.\nPre-Adventure is so beloved by a huge chunk of the fanbase due, of course, to its nostalgia, but also for its simplicity. The main goal was to build, but with the awesome and weird world generation of those versions, you couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but go explore. While you may have made yourself a home, there has always been this terrain feature in the distance you\u0026rsquo;ve been curious about, so you finally decide to go an investigate. What you find amazes you and so you decide to build something in that area. You have been inspired\u0026hellip; by the terrain. And you also have been inspired to further explore and find more weird and interesting areas.\nBeta version 1.7.3 World Generation\nMinecraft Adventure loses a lot of that charm. While Minecraft 1.0 world generation still retains the craziness of the prior versions, as the years progressed it had been overhauled many times, losing its wonderous nonsensical appeal, and then the added slew of RPG mechanics. No longer are you inspired to explore and build by curiosity alone but are encouraged to do so because that\u0026rsquo;s the next step in your progression.\nMinecraft Adventure 1.0 World Generation\nMinecraft Adventure 1.21.1 World Generation\nNot that any of that is bad. Personally, I prefer the Adventure update. I played Minecraft back in 2011; it was a lot of fun when my friends and I would spend hours on end just walking around the map and building bits and bobs here and there, but it stagnated very quickly for me. I saw and experienced a lot of really neat things, but when they began to lose their appeal because I had seen something similar to it before, what was the point to continue playing? I knew what to expect. I needed something telling me what I should do or work towards. It was many years before I would genuinely pick up Minecraft again, well after the 1.0 release.\nAs the years went by, I would revisit Minecraft every so often and each time I would enjoy myself. Sometimes those visits were by myself, others were with a bunch of friends. Sometimes it was a completely vanilla Minecraft world, others were heavily modded to expand the Minecraft experience.\nMinecraft 1.20.1 using Tectonic World Generation, Heavily Modded\nMinecraft has always been there, waiting. You might not be in the mood for it now, but at some point, a lot of you will have a sudden urge to visit it once again, and that\u0026rsquo;s what this is all about. Those of us that grew with Minecraft as a part of our lives always revisit it in some way - whether driven by nostalgia, the need to create, or the need for something simple and easy with no major commitment needed to pass the time.

It\u0026rsquo;s all of those.\nInformation sourced from the Minecraft Wiki\n","date":"12 October, 2024","id":9,"permalink":"/posts/what-is-minecraft-to-people/","summary":"After revisiting Minecraft once again I had some thoughts about the growth and major changes that Minecraft had over the years that, in my opinion, were to the detriment to the game.","tags":"opinion critique video-games minecraft all-posts","title":"What is Minecraft to People"},{"content":"\nThe Forever Winter, developed by Fun Dog Studios, recently entered Early Access on Steam and the Epic Game Store on September 24th.

And you, a mere scavenger, are there to collect whatever you can from giant mechs littering the open battlefield and claustrophobic trenches brimming with corpses to help keep your home operational and its people alive for another day.\nToo Long, Don\u0026rsquo;t Want to Read The game\u0026rsquo;s optimization is pretty bad, but that can be expected from an Early Access title made from a team of twenty people (thirty, according to the current website) with such a grand vision.\nThe controls can feel sluggish due to how your character responds to mouse and key inputs. It is not due to frame generation, it is simply the gameplay.\nThe third-person camera requires work as it can cause your character to block your view when situational awareness is a direct influence to your survival.\nThe game is difficult. You might as well be nothing more than dirt when compared to the warring factions.\nThe AI is a bit wonky with an added dash of infuriating. Their pathfinding reminds me of ArmA 3\u0026rsquo;s waypoints system assisted by a bad Zeus spawning a squad right on top of you.\nThe atmosphere, art style, and soundtrack are unrivaled.\nCritiques and What to Expect Optimization It needs a lot fo work. The developers are fully aware of the poor performance and are priioritizing getting it fixed and playable for those with rigs that are not up to date with the latest, greatest, and most embarrassing modern hardware. Currently, I have all my settings set to \u0026ldquo;Low\u0026rdquo; and I still get between forty-fice and sixty FPS; and that\u0026rsquo;s with a top-of-the-line computer.\nMovement You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t think anyone would need to say anything about this, but I think it is important to know before getting into the game. Everything feels sluggish; and that\u0026rsquo;s due to the nature of the game. It is meant to be a slow process because if you do not take care you will not survive.\nBut there are other factors contributing to this. For instance, you can only sprint forwards, not diagonally. This can lead to accidentally getting stuck on the corner of buildings and objects until you stop sprinting, which, in turn, can get you klled if you happened to be fleeing something. If you go into this game thinking the controls will handle like other third-person games like Assassin\u0026rsquo;s Creed or Tom Clancy\u0026rsquo;s Wildlands, you will be disappointed.\nCamera This third-person camera could use some fixes. First and foremost, in my opinion, would be the ability to switch shoulders. Currently, you are locked to viewing over the character\u0026rsquo;s right shoulder and this can be very detrimental when moving right-to-left around corners since you cannot see anything. You can circumvent this a little by aiming down your sights, but it is still more advantageous to move left-to-right around corners if possible as you can view around these obstacles without putting yourself at risk.\nAnother problem with the camera is that your character will block your view. This becomes more prominent when you are in a tight space or are up against a wall which results in pushing the camera closer to your character. A youtuber I watch said it best, \u0026ldquo;This game is begging to be a first person.\u0026rdquo; And I would have to agree. Situational awareness is key to surviving, and if you cannot see around yourself because the camera is working against you, you are going to die. I definitely don\u0026rsquo;t want this to be a first-person, mind you. It is best as a third-person game, but it needs tweaking.\nGameplay It. Is. Rough. It is not easy. One small mistake will get you killed if you are unprepared. For instance: a soldier blocks your path, so you decide to kill him; unbeknownst to you there were more just around the corner and now they are running full tilt in your direction; you turn to run but they get line-of-dight and promptly bathe you in a stream of hot leat.\nYou are nothing more than a fart in the wind that is quite literally an inconvienence to a squad of bio-engineered soldiers on their way to die themselves.\nYou are also a beacon for the enemy to spawn on top of. It is not intentional; you just happen to be standing on or right next to the plethora of spawn points on the map and the game doesn\u0026rsquo;t care if you are in the vicinity. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if this is something the developers are going to address, but I can see why they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even though it is extremely infuriating if it gets you killed: if they change the spawns to deactivate when you are near then there is not need to be afraid and constantly on the move. But I\u0026rsquo;m sure something can be done to still keep on the pressue without having the game cheat you.\nAI This is something that surprisngly doesn\u0026rsquo;t need too much work. What is there is adequate, but it can always be better. Currently, the AI seems to operate on a predetermined waypoint-like system until they stumble into an enemy; then they make a b-line for htem until they are within optimal range and proceed to stand in the open. If they survive, they will fall back onto their original waypoint loop and repeat the process until they are annihilated.\nGear You have a wide variety of weapons, rigs, and other items to customize your guns and backpacks, but detailed descriptions and other pertinent information is lacking. Until you purchase or acquire an item you have no idea what the benefits of them are until you put it on a weapon. If you found a foreggrip, the item description will just say \u0026ldquo;Foregrip B. Fits many things.\u0026rdquo;\nSo, with that variety you can essentially customize your guns like you would in Escape from Tarkov, but without the aesthetically pleasing interface that Tarkov has.\nThe standard weapon in the game will be Rifles, like you AKs and M4s. These will be your bread and butter as they are the easiest to use and the default character specializes in them.\nIn my experience so far, shotguns have been utter dogshit except when you have a couple Cyborgs rushing you as it then becomes trivial to headshot them. Otherwise? Don\u0026rsquo;t use them for anything unless you want to die. I haven\u0026rsquo;t used any of the automatic shotguns like the AA-12 yet, so maybe they are vastly superior to their pump-action counterparts.\nPistols are another option. I generally prefer taking a pistol over a shotgun due to everything weighing less and allowing me to carry more crap around with me. I\u0026rsquo;ve also had better luck with pistols saving my ass compared to a shotgun, surprisingly.\nHaven\u0026rsquo;t used SMGs a whole lot, but they\u0026rsquo;re similar to Rifles, just less damage.\nThere are also LMGs, Grenade Launchers, and specialty weapons that can only be found in raid. I ahven\u0026rsquo;t used any of them, but I\u0026rsquo;m hoping they\u0026rsquo;re good and relevant.\nAside from all that, you have your Rig, or backpack, to consider. There are different variants that you can earn and purchase and there are also parts you can acquire to further customize them. A Rig\u0026rsquo;s customization layout is like a keypad: the central being the main portion of the pack, then the outer slots surround the center. You can mix and match container types to either carry general debris or more large items like barrels of water or explosives.\nHUB Also know as The Innards, is your little home where you can choose to either run around to each station and vendor to do your business or you can just use the escape menu to do everything. As you progress you unock new vendors and can also purchase upgrades for you home. These upgrades are currently pretty minor as there are two legitimate upgrades available for purchase and then some cosmetic upgrades.\nEvery now and then your home will be raided by water bandits, so be prepared for that shock or you\u0026rsquo;ll lose all your water. They\u0026rsquo;re pretty easy to deal with if you know about it, but I did not\u0026hellip;\nConclusion There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of problems, and most really just come down to the game needing optimization, the AI needing some TLC, and an established endgame to work towards. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of potential for the game as long as the developers continue to be pro-consumer and continue to listen to the community like they are. In one of their Q\u0026amp;A\u0026rsquo;s people have given suggestions and their responses have been, \u0026ldquo;I like that, that\u0026rsquo;s fucking awesome.\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m not exactly sure what the end-goal of the game is. In Escape From Tarkov it is getting to a point where you can buy any piece of equipment you want and running any raid however you want, dabbing on Scavs and PMC\u0026rsquo;s alike. In The Forever Winter I only see quests needing to be completed and simply trying to survive and excursion as the driving force, because at no point are you going to go toe-to-toe with the enemies on the field unless you are in a party with other players.\nAll images have either been taken in-game by me or are sourced from the Fun Dog Studios website\n","date":"6 October, 2024","id":10,"permalink":"/posts/before-you-buy-the-forever-winter/","summary":"A quick and dirty rundown of The Forever Winter after its intial release into early access; not eloquent nor professional in the slightest.","tags":"early-access-review gaming video-games grimdark the-forever-winter all-posts","title":"Before You Buy- The Forever Winter"},{"content":"","date":"1 January, 0001","id":11,"permalink":"/tabletop/","summary":"","tags":"","title":""}]
