[{"content":"About Me Welcome to my humble little space in the absolute vastness that is the internet.\nI grew up in the early \u0026rsquo;90s, my first console being the awesome JVC X\u0026rsquo;Eye - a Sega Genesis created through a partnership between JVC and Sega - and the first game that I can remember on that console was my beloved Dune: Battle for Arrakis.\nEver since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve been gaming. Video games became my main passion and, through it, brought me to my other hobbies like writing, world creation, drawing, and other artistic avocations many people would label as a waste of time.\nIn this little recessed corner that I can call my own, my aim is to write about video games, and potentially other topics like film and tabletop games, in a care-free manner. No deadlines, no politics, no people pleasing - simply very unprofessional no-bullshit reviews, general thoughts, and anecdotes from the mind of an everyday insignificant gamer.\nWhat I Do Attempt to write about video games and my experiences with them Create mods for games like Vintage Story and Avorion Dabble, tinker and Distrohop more than a person should My Setup OS: Linux, EndeavourOS (Arch-based) Current Projects: Writing for the blog Creating a TTRPG using the Basic Role Playing system (i.e. Call of Cthulu) Attempting to actually complete a video game Computer Hardware: CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5900X GPU: PowerColor Red Devil AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Motherboard: Gigabyte x570 AORUS Elite RAM: G.Skill Trident Z Neo Series 2x32GB Website History The Insignificant Gamer is an independent publication launched in October 2024 by Sean R., also known by his online alias Just_Irish.
