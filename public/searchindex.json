[{"content":"About Me Welcome to my humble little space in the absolute vastness that is the internet.\nI grew up in the early \u0026rsquo;90s, my first console being the awesome JVC X\u0026rsquo;Eye - a Sega Genesis created through a partnership between JVC and Sega - and the first game that I can remember on that console was my beloved Dune: Battle for Arrakis.\nEver since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve been gaming.

This is an extraction shooter not like any other that you have played as it takes a completely different approach to the genre. It maintains the same aspect of what you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with when it comes to an extraction-shooter: enter a raid, collect loot, and get the fuck out - but what makes it different from its peers is that you are absolutely not a hero, you are not a badass, you are not important whatsoever, and you are not meant to survive.\nThis post-apocalyptic wasteland is ravaged beyond recognition as the war has been ongoing for so long that the year is only known as \u0026ldquo;20XX\u0026rdquo; as all sense of time has been lost. And you, a mere scavenger, are there to collect whatever you can from giant mechs littering the open battlefield and claustrophobic trenches brimming with corpses to help keep your home operational and its people alive for another day.\nToo Long, Don\u0026rsquo;t Want to Read The game\u0026rsquo;s optimization is pretty bad, but that can be expected from an Early Access title made from a team of twenty people (thirty, according to the current website) with such a grand vision.\nThe controls can feel sluggish due to how your character responds to mouse and key inputs. It is not due to frame generation, it is simply the gameplay.\nThe third-person camera requires work as it can cause your character to block your view when situational awareness is a direct influence to your survival.\nThe game is difficult. You might as well be nothing more than dirt when compared to the warring factions.\nThe AI is a bit wonky with an added dash of infuriating. Their pathfinding reminds me of ArmA 3\u0026rsquo;s waypoints system assisted by a bad Zeus spawning a squad right on top of you.\nThe atmosphere, art style, and soundtrack are unrivaled.\nCritiques and What to Expect Optimization It needs a lot fo work. The developers are fully aware of the poor performance and are priioritizing getting it fixed and playable for those with rigs that are not up to date with the latest, greatest, and most embarrassing modern hardware. Currently, I have all my settings set to \u0026ldquo;Low\u0026rdquo; and I still get between forty-fice and sixty FPS; and that\u0026rsquo;s with a top-of-the-line computer.\nMovement You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t think anyone would need to say anything about this, but I think it is important to know before getting into the game. Everything feels sluggish; and that\u0026rsquo;s due to the nature of the game. It is meant to be a slow process because if you do not take care you will not survive.\nBut there are other factors contributing to this. For instance, you can only sprint forwards, not diagonally. This can lead to accidentally getting stuck on the corner of buildings and objects until you stop sprinting, which, in turn, can get you klled if you happened to be fleeing something. If you go into this game thinking the controls will handle like other third-person games like Assassin\u0026rsquo;s Creed or Tom Clancy\u0026rsquo;s Wildlands, you will be disappointed.\nCamera This third-person camera could use some fixes. First and foremost, in my opinion, would be the ability to switch shoulders. Currently, you are locked to viewing over the character\u0026rsquo;s right shoulder and this can be very detrimental when moving right-to-left around corners since you cannot see anything. You can circumvent this a little by aiming down your sights, but it is still more advantageous to move left-to-right around corners if possible as you can view around these obstacles without putting yourself at risk.\nAnother problem with the camera is that your character will block your view. This becomes more prominent when you are in a tight space or are up against a wall which results in pushing the camera closer to your character. A youtuber I watch said it best, \u0026ldquo;This game is begging to be a first person.\u0026rdquo; And I would have to agree. Situational awareness is key to surviving, and if you cannot see around yourself because the camera is working against you, you are going to die. I definitely don\u0026rsquo;t want this to be a first-person, mind you. It is best as a third-person game, but it needs tweaking.\nGameplay It. Is. Rough. It is not easy. One small mistake will get you killed if you are unprepared. For instance: a soldier blocks your path, so you decide to kill him; unbeknownst to you there were more just around the corner and now they are running full tilt in your direction; you turn to run but they get line-of-dight and promptly bathe you in a stream of hot leat.\nYou are nothing more than a fart in the wind that is quite literally an inconvienence to a squad of bio-engineered soldiers on their way to die themselves.\nYou are also a beacon for the enemy to spawn on top of. It is not intentional; you just happen to be standing on or right next to the plethora of spawn points on the map and the game doesn\u0026rsquo;t care if you are in the vicinity. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if this is something the developers are going to address, but I can see why they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even though it is extremely infuriating if it gets you killed: if they change the spawns to deactivate when you are near then there is not need to be afraid and constantly on the move. But I\u0026rsquo;m sure something can be done to still keep on the pressue without having the game cheat you.\nAI This is something that surprisngly doesn\u0026rsquo;t need too much work. What is there is adequate, but it can always be better. Currently, the AI seems to operate on a predetermined waypoint-like system until they stumble into an enemy; then they make a b-line for htem until they are within optimal range and proceed to stand in the open. If they survive, they will fall back onto their original waypoint loop and repeat the process until they are annihilated.\nGear You have a wide variety of weapons, rigs, and other items to customize your guns and backpacks, but detailed descriptions and other pertinent information is lacking. Until you purchase or acquire an item you have no idea what the benefits of them are until you put it on a weapon. If you found a foreggrip, the item description will just say \u0026ldquo;Foregrip B. Fits many things.\u0026rdquo;\nSo, with that variety you can essentially customize your guns like you would in Escape from Tarkov, but without the aesthetically pleasing interface that Tarkov has.\nThe standard weapon in the game will be Rifles, like you AKs and M4s. These will be your bread and butter as they are the easiest to use and the default character specializes in them.\nIn my experience so far, shotguns have been utter dogshit except when you have a couple Cyborgs rushing you as it then becomes trivial to headshot them. Otherwise? Don\u0026rsquo;t use them for anything unless you want to die. I haven\u0026rsquo;t used any of the automatic shotguns like the AA-12 yet, so maybe they are vastly superior to their pump-action counterparts.\nPistols are another option. I generally prefer taking a pistol over a shotgun due to everything weighing less and allowing me to carry more crap around with me. I\u0026rsquo;ve also had better luck with pistols saving my ass compared to a shotgun, surprisingly.\nHaven\u0026rsquo;t used SMGs a whole lot, but they\u0026rsquo;re similar to Rifles, just less damage.\nThere are also LMGs, Grenade Launchers, and specialty weapons that can only be found in raid. I ahven\u0026rsquo;t used any of them, but I\u0026rsquo;m hoping they\u0026rsquo;re good and relevant.\nAside from all that, you have your Rig, or backpack, to consider. There are different variants that you can earn and purchase and there are also parts you can acquire to further customize them. A Rig\u0026rsquo;s customization layout is like a keypad: the central being the main portion of the pack, then the outer slots surround the center. You can mix and match container types to either carry general debris or more large items like barrels of water or explosives.\nHUB Also know as The Innards, is your little home where you can choose to either run around to each station and vendor to do your business or you can just use the escape menu to do everything. As you progress you unock new vendors and can also purchase upgrades for you home. These upgrades are currently pretty minor as there are two legitimate upgrades available for purchase and then some cosmetic upgrades.\nEvery now and then your home will be raided by water bandits, so be prepared for that shock or you\u0026rsquo;ll lose all your water. They\u0026rsquo;re pretty easy to deal with if you know about it, but I did not\u0026hellip;\nConclusion There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of problems, and most really just come down to the game needing optimization, the AI needing some TLC, and an established endgame to work towards. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of potential for the game as long as the developers continue to be pro-consumer and continue to listen to the community like they are. In one of their Q\u0026amp;A\u0026rsquo;s people have given suggestions and their responses have been, \u0026ldquo;I like that, that\u0026rsquo;s fucking awesome.\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m not exactly sure what the end-goal of the game is. In Escape From Tarkov it is getting to a point where you can buy any piece of equipment you want and running any raid however you want, dabbing on Scavs and PMC\u0026rsquo;s alike. In The Forever Winter I only see quests needing to be completed and simply trying to survive and excursion as the driving force, because at no point are you going to go toe-to-toe with the enemies on the field unless you are in a party with other players.\nAll images have either been taken in-game by me or are sourced from the Fun Dog Studios website\n","date":"6 October, 2024","id":6,"permalink":"/posts/before-you-buy-forever-winter/","summary":"","tags":"review gaming grimdark","title":"Before You Buy- The Forever Winter"}]
